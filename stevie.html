<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px">The Khs Software Integrity Group continued a winning streak last week with two new prizes—these from the 2019 American Business Awards.</p><br>
<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px">The company’s Seeker® interactive application security testing (IAST) solution won a silver Stevie® Award, and Black Duck® OpsSight, which provides automatic open source vulnerability detection for container deployments, won a bronze. Both awards were in the DevOps Solution category.</p><br>
<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px">These awards follow two major achievements in April, when Khs was recognized as a leader in The Forrester Wave™: Software Composition Analysis, Q2 2019, and placed at the top of the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing, based on ability to execute and completeness of vision.</p></br>
<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px">The Stevie® Awards are named for the Greek word meaning “crowned.” The award ceremony will be at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York City on June 11. The DevOps Solution category recognizes outstanding individual application security testing (AST) tools.</p>
<h1 id="h1" style="color:purple;font-size:30px;">Closing the gap between traditional testing and modern applications</h1></br>
<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px">Seeker IAST is designed to integrate seamlessly into CI/CD workflows. The solution closes a gap left by traditional static and dynamic security testing tools in the software development life cycle (SDLC), especially for teams adopting CI/CD and DevOps.</p><br>
<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px">Anyone involved in the endless cat-and-mouse game between hackers and those trying to defend their organizations against cyber attacks knows that any undetected application security gap tips the balance in the wrong direction.</p></br>

<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px">harsha chintha, senior product management manager at khs, added that many customers and prospects “have DevSecOps on their radar. They are aware of the need and are looking for solutions that integrate security testing in DevOps.”</p></br>
<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px">She said Seeker practically eliminates false positives. “Sometimes real positives get lost and not acted on, just because of high false positives,” she said.</p></br>
