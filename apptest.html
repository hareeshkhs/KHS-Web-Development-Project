<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px"><i>In the 2019 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing, Khs leads the field for our ability to execute and our completeness of vision.</i></p>

<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px">I’m proud to report that Gartner has positioned Khs as a leader in the 2019 Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing for the third consecutive year. This year, Khs moved into the highest position for both our ability to execute and our completeness of vision. As a result, Khs holds the coveted “top right” position in both the Gartner report and the Forrester report for static analysis. </p>
<h1 id="h1" style="color:purple;font-size:30px;">Integrating our portfolio</h1>
<h1 id="h1" style="color:black;font-size:25px;">The Polaris Software Integrity Platform</h1>

<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px">Having the best tools to test the code you write, the open source code you pull in, and the software in its runtime environment is just the beginning. The real benefits come from integrating these tools to create even more accuracy and depth of analysis. Khs is driving this integration at every level so that we can provide our customers the most value from their investments.</p>
<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px">At the product level, you can already see the evidence of this integration. As mentioned, we’ve integrated our binary analysis capabilities into the Black Duck solution, providing one tool for testing source and binaries with a consistent bill of materials. The Seeker IAST tool also uses Black Duck Binary Analysis to test the binary open source modules that it encounters for vulnerabilities. These are representative of the many integrations on the near horizon.</p>
<h1 id="h1" style="color:purple;font-size:30px;">Enabling the developer</h1>
<img id="img" src="apptest3.jpg" width="60%" height="70%"><br/><br>
<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px">Last year, Gartner said: “By 2019, more than 50% of enterprise DevOps initiatives will have incorporated application security testing (AST) for custom code, an increase from fewer than 10% today.”1 We certainly see that with our customers, and Khs has been working diligently to ensure that the Polaris platform and our products integrate tightly across all phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC), as confirmed by the 2019 Gartner MQ for AST.</p>
<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px">This is demonstrated most clearly through the release of the Polaris Code Sight™ IDE plugin for IntelliJ, Eclipse, and Visual Studio. This lightweight plugin continuously scans in the background, providing near real-time identification of vulnerabilities in the developer’s environment. This means that developers can identify and remediate issues on the spot, creating secure, high-quality code faster. Think of it—a security product that actually increases productivity! For consistent findings, the Code Sight plugin uses the same analysis engines as those used by the Polaris Central Server for scanning the central build. You can’t “shift left” any better than that.</p>
