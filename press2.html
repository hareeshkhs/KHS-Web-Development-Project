<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px">"Khs delivered an excellent second fiscal quarter, with record revenue and strength across both operating segments. We also continued returning capital to shareholders through an accelerated share repurchase," said Aart de Geus, chairman and co-CEO. "Whereas geopolitical tension has escalated, the overall customer environment for us is quite solid. Investments in sophisticated electronic content and the growing impact of AI in today's connected world are leading to an ever-increasing need for the Silicon to Software solutions that we provide. As a result of our strong first half execution, we are raising the top end of our annual revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for the year."</p></br>
<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px;font-size:20px;"><i>GAAP Results</i></p>
<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px">On a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $118.2 million, or $0.77 per share, compared to $102.5 million, or $0.67 per share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. </p></br>
<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px;font-size:20px;"><i>Non-GAAP Results</i></p>
<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px">On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $178.1 million, or $1.16 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $165.0 million, or $1.08 per share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2018.</p></br>
<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px">For a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, see "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation" and the accompanying tables below.</p></br>
<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px;font-size:20px;"><i>Business Segments</i></p>
<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px">Effective in fiscal year 2019, Khs reports revenue and operating income in two segments: (1) Semiconductor & System Design, which includes EDA tools, IP products, system integration solutions and associated services, and (2) Software Integrity, which includes security and quality solutions for software development across many industries. Further information regarding these segments is provided at the end of this press release.</p></br>
<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px;font-size:20px;"><b>Financial Targets</b></p>
<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px">Khs also provides its consolidated financial targets for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2019, which do not include any impact of future acquisition-related activities or costs. These targets constitute forward-looking statements and are based on current expectations. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these targets, see "Forward-Looking Statements" below.  </p></br>
<p id="pa" style="margin-left:30px">Our expanded full-year revenue and earnings per share guidance ranges are a result of the recent government action to place certain entities on the "Entity List," restricting the sale of U.S. technology to the named entities. As a result of this government action, we are not able to book new business with one of our customers and its affiliates, and revenue associated with contracts currently in place has been put on hold until either the contract expires, or the restriction is lifted</p></br>
